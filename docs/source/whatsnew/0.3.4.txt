Release 0.3.4
-------------

:Release: 0.3.4
:Date: September 15, 2015

New Features
------------

* Added support for Spark 1.4 on Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 (:issue:`294`)

Experimental Features
---------------------

.. warning::

   Experimental features are subject to change.

* Add support for specifying primary and foreign key relationships in the SQL
  backend (:issue:`274`).

New Backends
------------

None

Improved Backends
-----------------

* Dialect discovery on CSV files now samples a subset of the file. This allows
  S3(CSV) to have correct values for its dialect (:issue:`293`).
* Loading a set of files on a s3 bucket with a prefix into a redshift database
  now works (:issue:`293`).

API Changes
-----------

None

Bug Fixes
---------

* Cope with Dask and bcolz API changes (:issue:`270`).
* Fixed a bug where columns in dshape were being ignored when converting
  a numpy array to a DataFrame (:issue:`273`).
* Fix appending into a sql table from chunks not returning the table.
  (:issue:`278`).
* Fix a bug where ``'pytables://'`` wasn't being properly stripped off the URI
  (:issue:`292`)
* Fix a bug where a non-existent header row was being removed from an S3(CSV)
  because the dialect was set incorrectly (:issue:`293`)
* Fix a bug where the SparkSQL backend wouldn't work if we didn't have paramiko installed (:issue:`300`)
* Fix a testing bug where the endlines were being compared and they
  shouldn't have been (:issue:`312`).
* Fix a bug where sniffing multibyte encodings potentially chopped off
  part of the encoded string (:issue:`309`, :issue:`311`).

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Adds :func:`~odo.utils.copydoc` function to copy docstrings from one object
  onto another. This helps with the pattern of explicitly setting the
  ``__doc__`` attribute to the ``__doc__`` of another function or class. This
  function can be used as a decorator like: ``@copydoc(FromThisClass)`` or as a
  function like: ``copydoc(FromThisClass, to_this_function)``. (:issue:`277`).
