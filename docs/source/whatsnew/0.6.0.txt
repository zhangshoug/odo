Release 0.6.0
=============

:Release: 0.6.0
:Date: TBD

New Features
------------

* When an edge fails in ``convert`` we will now consider both the path from the
  source to the target with the broken edge removed as well as the path from the
  current value to the target. This can prevent a lot of duplicated work when
  the new path shares a prefix with the original path (:issue:`449`).

* ``convert`` will now search the entire mro of the source type. This means that
  you can convert a subclass of a known source type into a known destination
  type (:issue:`518`).

Experimental Features
---------------------

.. warning::

   Experimental features are subject to change.

None

New Backends
------------

None

Improved Backends
-----------------

* Optimized `chunks` backend to allow parallel evaluation using `dask`
  whenever the iteratable is a list of callables.

* Improved performance of CSV -> SQL Table.

* Improved performance of pandas DataFrame -> SQL Table.

API Changes
-----------

None

Bug Fixes
---------

* Correctly handles low-precision decimal fields (:issue:`479`).

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Odo now has extra install targets for installing different subsystems. For
  example: ``odo[postgres]``, ``odo[bcolz]``, and ``odo[pytables]``. There are
  also three special targets: ``odo[all]``, ``odo[test]`` and ``odo[ci]``.
  ``odo[all]`` installs all of the subsystems available through the various
  non-special targets. ``odo[test]`` installs the dependencies needed to run the
  test suite. Note: you will still need to setup the testing databases
  externally. ``odo[ci]`` is a set of strict (==) requirements  which will be
  used to run the tests on travis and other CI services. This can be used to
  reproduce the test environment that the automated tests ran in (:issue:`496`).

* We now run the CI on a frozen set of dependencies to make it easier to
  reproduce a testing environment. One downside of this is that we will need to
  manually keep our packages up to date; however, if someone wants to own a
  package update we will be very willing to help support that (:issue:`496`).
